Hi Bart,

Here are the notes from the SF Ad Publishers Meetup Monthly Meetup on 5/8 at Mojiva.

They are written for me to remember what was going on, not in the way you would take meeting notes in daily work. That means that if you plan to publish them, it might take a little bit of work...

I think the ad meetups are awesome, by the way! As opposed to many other meetups, there are all great events. Kind of like All Good Apps!

Best Regards,

Harald Rudell
